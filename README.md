## Overview

### Description
Starca is a storage marketplace that allows users to either list their unusued space to make some extra income or look for listed places so they can store items that are taking up lots of space in their household.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** P2P Marketplace
- **Mobile:** This app is being primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as usable on a computer, similarly to Zillow, Apartments, etc. Mobile version would provide for better features and prove to be more convenient, as you would want to search/manage rental properties while not constricted to a computer.
- **Story:** Allow landlords to post unused storage spaces for tenants to search for. Connects people looking to rent their storage space and people who are looking for a storage space at a rate best for them.
- **Market:** Individuals that are looking to make some extra income by renting out unused space and those that need to clear up space in their house but don't want to pay the high prices for traditional storage facilities
- **Habit:** This app is not meant to be used consistently. Renters and rentees can "set it and forget it"
- **Scope:** Start by allowing users to post their storage spaces for rent and allowing users to search for storage spaces. Provide a platform for these two user groups to connect.
